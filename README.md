### Express JS CRUD Application using mongoDB 

Project Description
-- An online store for a futuristic tech company making bionic body parts,brain implants, and clones (satirical vibes) -- think keanu reeves in Replica type company with ghost in a shell final product with a hint of the matrix

-- Use my love of science fiction books/movies and create a futuristic utopian/dystopian store created by a fake tech company

Models
-- products
-- users and set so only admin can create/edit/delete products
-- wishlist since none of the items are available yet

Wins
-- learning how to require fs which made using my own assets folder really easy and pulled the styling together
-- fully functional naviagtion bar
-- users set so only admin can create/edit/delete products 

Unsolved Problems
-- Pushing the products to a wishlist (put method)
-- Struggling to pull the data from one schema into another (Post MVP Goal)

Additional Post-MVP Goals
-- Countdown to release date
-- Live chat forum with feedback forum after that uses Nodemailer for email feedback
